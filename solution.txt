 the main difference between gits slash apply and git pop is -

git stash pop throws away the (topmost, by default) stash after applying it,
whereas git stash apply leaves it in the stash list for possible later reuse 
(or you can then git stash drop it).
This happens unless there are conflicts after git stash pop, 
in which case it will not remove the stash, leaving it to behave exactly like git stash apply.

Another way to look at it: git stash pop is git stash apply && git stash drop.
like this :
git stash :apply
git pop : apply+drop 

What happens in git statsh apply is if any content is inside the stack then it will apply only changes,
to it and same( git stash pop )kya karta hai ki woh stack se content leke apply ke satah saath drop kar dega 
this is the difference.
